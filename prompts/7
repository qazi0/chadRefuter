Integrate an SQLite database into the existing Reddit bot @Codebase  to store and manage Reddit posts, metadata, and LLM-generated responses efficiently. The database should allow logging of processed posts, tracking interactions, and ensuring no duplicate responses.

-------
Step 1: Define Database Schema & Setup
Instruction:

Implement an SQLite database using the sqlite3 library.
Create a database file (e.g., reddit_bot.db) if it doesn’t exist.
Define a table named posts with the following schema:
id (Primary Key, Auto-increment)
post_id (Unique, stores Reddit post ID)
subreddit (Stores the subreddit name)
title (Stores the post title)
post_text (Stores the full post body)
author (Stores the username of the post creator)
timestamp (Stores the creation time of the post)
llm_response (Stores the generated response from the LLM)
response_timestamp (Stores the time when the bot responded)
Ensure all database operations are handled within a try-except block for robustness.

-------
Step 2: Implement Database Interaction Methods
Instruction:

Implement helper functions to interact with the database:
initialize_database() → Creates the posts table if it doesn’t exist.
save_post(post_id, subreddit, title, post_text, author, timestamp, llm_response, response_timestamp) → Inserts a new record after processing a post.
check_if_post_exists(post_id) → Returns True if the post is already in the database to avoid duplicate processing.
fetch_last_n_posts(n=5) → Retrieves the latest n posts the bot has interacted with.
fetch_unreplied_comments(post_id) → Retrieves comments on a post that need responses.
Optimize queries using indexed searches to ensure performance.

-------
Step 3: Modify the Bot to Use the Database
Instruction:

Before processing a new post, call check_if_post_exists(post_id). If it exists, skip the post to avoid duplicate interactions.
After generating an LLM response, store it in the database using save_post().
Periodically fetch and log the last 5 posts the bot interacted with using fetch_last_n_posts().
Extend the comment-tracking logic to store and track replies to the bot’s responses using an additional table comments (optional but recommended).

-------
Step 4: Ensure Logging & Debugging
Instruction:

Log every database transaction to a reddit_bot.log file for auditing.
Print debugging messages indicating when posts are added, skipped, or retrieved from the database.
Implement a safe shutdown procedure to close database connections gracefully on exit.

Ensure code completeness, accuracy and compatibility with previously written code
