Your task is to generate a fully functional, production-ready Reddit bot that has the following features:

1. Periodically scan a subreddit for new posts (every 60 seconds).
2. Detect unprocessed posts and query a local LLM for a response.
3. Comment the generated response on the detected Reddit post.
4. Monitor for replies to its own comments every 5 minutes.
5. Maintain a conversation thread by continuing to interact with users.
6. Track up to 5 active conversations at any time.
7. Implement rate-limiting, logging, error handling, and state tracking to ensure stability.
8. Run as a background service with structured logging for monitoring.

Ensure you follow modular coding best practices, ensuring that the project has an appropriate directory structure, and each function has a clear responsibility and is easily testable. Prioritize efficiency, maintainability, and API compliance while implementing this bot.

We will begin implementing this stage by stage, building an initial MVP first and then adding features on top of it.

## Stage 1: Setting Up the Reddit Bot Framework
Task: Implement the foundational structure of the bot using the praw library for Reddit API interactions.

### Instructions for Code Generation
- Create a Python project structured for modularity.
- Use praw (Python Reddit API Wrapper) for API interaction instead of raw HTTP requests.
- Implement OAuth authentication via Reddit's API (using credentials from praw.ini or .env).
- Log every interaction to both the terminal and a persistent log file using Python’s logging module.
- Ensure the bot runs as a background process (daemon-like behavior).
- Implement rate-limiting safeguards by respecting Reddit’s API rules.
- Set up environment variable support for storing sensitive credentials.
### Code Specifications

Modules:
- bot.py (main entry point)
- reddit_api.py (handles Reddit API authentication and interactions)
- logger.py (handles structured logging)
- config.py (configuration management)

Environment Variables:
CLIENT_ID
CLIENT_SECRET
USERNAME
PASSWORD
USER_AGENT

# Expected Output for Stage 1:
A basic skeleton of a Reddit bot capable of authenticating with Reddit’s API using praw
