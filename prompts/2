### Stage 2: Implementing Subreddit Scanning and Post Handling
Task: Develop the bot’s ability to scan a specific subreddit every minute for new posts.

#### Instructions for Code Generation
-The bot should continuously scan the subreddit every 60 seconds.
-Use PRAW’s subreddit.new(limit=5) to fetch the latest posts.
-Maintain a cache of processed post IDs (use a simple in-memory set for now, make the code drop-in replaceable with redis later).
-Upon detecting a new post, extract the title and body.
-Log the post retrieval event, post title, as well as first 10 characters of the post body.

Code Specifications
-Implement threaded or async scheduling (schedule or asyncio).
-Store processed post IDs in a simple in-memory set for now, make the code drop-in replaceable with redis later
-Define a helper function fetch_new_posts(subreddit: str) -> list[dict].

Expected Output for Stage 2
-The bot should detect new posts and log them but not yet process replies.
